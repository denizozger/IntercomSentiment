PADME: Oh, Anakin!
ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things. 
ANAKIN: What things? 
PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings. 
ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. 
PADME: He cares about us. 
ANAKIN: Us??! 
PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you. 
ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough. 
PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.
ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this. 
ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you. 
PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can. 
ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed. 
ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. 
PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow.
ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan? 
PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
ANAKIN: Liar! 
PADME: No! 
ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me! 
PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
